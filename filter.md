The **filter bubble** commonly refers to the **manipulation** of **social media feeds** by automated algorithms<sup>[1]</sup> which leads to _internet users_ encountering only information and opinions that conform to and reinforce their own beliefs. 

In other words, this means if you're racist for example, your feed will show you information and opinions that conform to you, effectively enforcing your racism and possibly radicalizing you.

**Woah. That's really troubling but...**
#### **Why does it happen?**
Well big social networks **(Instagram, Facebook, Tiktok, etc)** are run by for-profit corporations, they face a dilemma like all businesses, how do we make money? The answer is **ads**. That is why you see so many ads on Youtube and elsewhere.  

They also face another issue, they need to make as much money from ads as possible. The solution to this is to show relevant ads to each user, to show you relevant ads they collect data on you. Oh look, Talhah _likes posts_ about gadgets, lets show him an AD for the coolest gadget!  

But wait relevant ads aren't enough, we need to make more money from this. Lets keep Talhah engaged to our platform, hmm we can do this by showing Talhah **posts** which conform to his mindset and interests. So lets show him posts related to computers.

Now lets do this automatically with an AI which figures out what **each** individual user likes so we can show them relevant ads and posts to keep them engaged. **$$$**

#### **What's the problem?**
The AI doesn't know what ethics are..**it does what we tell it to do, which is keeping users engaged!** This has side effects as the AI for example learns someone who has a racist mindset can be engaged by showing them content which conforms to what they think (being racist). Yes this means radicalizing them unintentionally and a computer does not know any better. This is why we call it a _filter bubble_.  

It leads to intellectual isolation and seeing only one side of something as you're in a bubble. Misinformation can thrive as everyone in the bubble is similar and may believe it. This was evident with the capitol protesters as it led to a mass amount of people believing something far from reality. We too are affected by this, while it may not be radicalizing us as such I have noticed **many** people falling for/posting misinformation as they see only one side (and funnily enough some of these people argue and tell others to educate themselves).



#### **What can we do?**
I'd love hear your suggestions as well.
- Fact check things before sharing it!
- Search for alternative viewpoints, don't expect it to come to you
- Start contributing and donating to alternative social networks, some have proposed open source and decentralized networks which won't suffer from this problem. **Put your money where your mouth stands** and support them if you can!
- Don't use these networks
